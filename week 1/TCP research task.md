# TASK WEEK 1

# Research Task (TCP/IP) suite

## (Transmisson Control Protocol / Internet Protocol)

**1- whats is the protocol ??**

-Rules for communication and data exchange

-like a standard way how to act or how to communicate

### Notes

-the protocol have a specific use and all prtocols associated to do great use

-the networking process like a team work protocols to do this network

-it is designed by DoD (Department of Deffense)

### **What is Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)?**

TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol. It is a transport layer protocol that facilitates the transmission of packets from source to destination. It is a connection-oriented protocol that means it establishes the connection prior to the communication that occurs between the computing devices in a network. This protocol is used with an [IP](https://www.javatpoint.com/ip-full-form) protocol, so together, they are referred to as a [TCP/IP](https://www.javatpoint.com/tcp-ip-full-form).

# TCP more detailed

- The main functionality of the TCP is to take the data from the application layer. Then it divides the data into a several packets, provides numbering to these packets, and finally transmits these packets to the destination. The TCP, on the other side, will reassemble the packets and transmits them to the application layer. As we know that TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, so the connection will remain established until the communication is not completed between the sender and the receiver.

# Advantages of TCP

- • It provides a connection-oriented reliable service, which means that it guarantees the delivery of data packets. If the data packet is lost across the network, then the TCP will resend the lost packets.
- • It provides a flow control mechanism using a sliding window protocol.
- • It provides error detection by using checksum and error control by using Go Back or ARP protocol.

# My talk about this (TCP) reasearch

TCP gives to user permissions which saves his time , save data from damage or to be corrupted

as it is use error control and acknowledment mechanisms to deliver the data with safe way and its firstly check their is a good connection between sender and receiver before the process of transfering of the data. after that their is a process called three-way handshaking which in it checking the connection state , data converted to packets with sequence as in other way receiver reassemble the data by thier sequence and so on.
