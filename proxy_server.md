# **Proxy Servers**
 >### 1. *What is a Proxy Server?*
A proxy server acts as an intermediary between clients (such as web browsers) and the internet. It receives requests from clients and forwards them to the destination (e.g., web servers) on their behalf. The destination server then sends the response back to the proxy server, which, in turn, forwards it to the client. The primary purpose of a proxy server is to improve performance, security, and privacy
A proxy server acts as an intermediary between the user and the web server. Proxy servers use a different IP address on behalf of the user, concealing the user's real address from web servers.

 > ### 2. *Types of Proxy Servers:*

1. **_Forward Proxy:_**
A forward proxy (commonly known as a ‘proxy') is a type of proxy server that typically passes requests from users in an internal network to the Internet via a firewall. 
Forward proxies are configured to either ‘allow' or ‘deny' the user's request to pass through the firewall to access content on the Internet.
If the proxy allows the user's request, it forwards it to the web server through the firewall. The web server sends its response to the proxy. The proxy then sends this response back to the user
A forward proxy will first check if the user's requested information is cached before retrieving it from the server. The proxy stores cached information itself, eliminating the need to request it from the server. If the requested information is cached, the proxy will send it directly to the user.
If the proxy denies the user's request, it sends the user an error or redirect message

4. **_Transparent Proxy:_** Intercepts internet traffic without modifying it, so the destination server is unaware of the proxy's presence. Transparent proxies are often used for caching purposes.
5. **_Anonymous Proxy:_**
An anonymous proxy focuses on making internet activity untraceable. It works by accessing the internet on behalf of the user while hiding their identity and computer information.
A anonymous proxy is best suited for users who want to have full anonymity while accessing the internet. While anonymous proxies provide some of the best identity protection possible, they are not without drawbacks. Many view the use of anonymous proxies as underhanded, and users sometimes face pushback or discrimination as a result.
6. **_Distorting Proxy_**
A distorting proxy identifies itself as a proxy to a website but hides its own identity. It does this by changing its IP address to an incorrect one.

7. **_High Anonymity Proxy:_**
A high anonymity proxy is an anonymous proxy that takes anonymity one step further. It works by erasing your information before the proxy attempts to connect to the target site.

8. **_SSL Proxy:_**
A secure sockets layer (SSL) proxy provides decryption between the client and the server. As the data is encrypted in both directions, the proxy hides its existence from both the client and the server.

9. **_Rotating Proxy:_**
A rotating proxy assigns a different IP address to each user that connects to it. As users connect, they are given an address that is unique from the device that connected before it.

 > ### 3. *How Proxy Servers Work:*

1. **_Request Forwarding:_**
 When a client sends a request to access a web page, the proxy server intercepts the request and forwards it to the destination server on behalf of the client.

2. **_Response Handling:_** 
The destination server sends the response back to the proxy server, which, in turn, sends it to the client.
3. **_Caching:_**
 Proxies can store copies of frequently accessed web pages, reducing the load on destination servers and improving response times for clients.
4. **_Filtering:_**
 Proxy servers can be used to filter and block specific content, restricting access to certain websites or content categories.
5. **_Anonymity:_**
 Some proxy servers provide anonymity by hiding the client's IP address from the destination server, enhancing privacy.

 > ### 4. *Benefits of Using a Proxy Server:*

1. **_Improved Performance:_** Caching frequently accessed content can reduce bandwidth usage and accelerate page load times.

2. **_Enhanced Security:_**
 Proxies can act as an additional layer of defense, hiding internal network details and blocking malicious content.
3. **_Content Filtering:_** 
 Proxies can be used to restrict access to specific websites or types of content, beneficial for organizations and institutions.
4. **_Privacy and Anonymity:_** Certain types of proxies can hide the client's IP address, providing a degree of anonymity during internet activities.
5. **_Filtering of encrypted data:_**
Web filtering proxies are not able to peer inside secure sockets HTTP transactions, assuming the chain-of-trust of SSL/TLS (Transport Layer Security) has not been tampered with. The SSL/TLS chain-of-trust relies on trusted root certificate authorities.

6. **_Caching:_** Proxies can cache frequently accessed web content, reducing the need to fetch data from the origin server repeatedly.

7. **_Security and Firewall Bypass:_**
If the destination server filters content based on the origin of the request, the use of a proxy can circumvent this filter. For example, a server using IP-based geolocation to restrict its service to a certain country can be accessed using a proxy located in that country to access the service.
Proxies can bypass restrictive firewalls and provide an additional layer of security against malicious traffic.

> ### 10. *_Proxy Server vs. VPN_*

Though proxies and VPNs both provide privacy, they do it differently. When comparing proxy vs. VPN capabilities, the difference is that proxies strictly act as a gateway between the internet and users. On the other hand, VPN traffic runs through an encrypted tunnel and the user's device, making VPNs an effective solution for ensuring network security.


A VPN is similar to a proxy server in that it makes internet traffic appear to be coming from a remote IP address. However, with VPNs, traffic runs through an encrypted tunnel between the remote VPN network and the user's computer or device, making VPNs an effective solution for ensuring network security. 

A VPN from a reliable provider ensures users have a safe way to browse the internet, especially when using Wi-Fi at a public location like a café. Users can connect to a VPN instead of a local Wi-Fi, which, when unencrypted or using weak security, can expose private information to others.

> ### 11.*_Which is Better: VPN or Proxy?_*
While proxy servers and VPNs may seem similar on the surface, they are two different solutions. So which should your business choose, a VPN or proxy? 

VPNs provide greater protection because they encrypt traffic. For organizations that deal with sensitive data and need to keep their browsing activity hidden, a VPN is the ideal solution. 

Organizations that are simply looking for users to browse the internet anonymously can benefit from a proxy server. This also enables them to see which websites their employees are visiting and ensure employees can access sites that would otherwise be blocked in their country.
