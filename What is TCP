<h1>What is Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)</h1>
<p>TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is one of the main protocols of the Internet protocol suite.
It lies between the Application and Network Layers which are used in providing reliable delivery
services. It is a connection-oriented protocol for communications that helps in the exchange of
messages between different devices over a network. The Internet Protocol (IP),
which establishes the technique for sending data packets between computers, works with TCP.</p>
<BR><BR>
<h1>Working of TCP</h1>
<p>To make sure that each message reaches its target location intact, the TCP/IP model breaks down the
data into small bundles and afterward reassembles the bundles into the original message on the opposite end.
Sending the information in little bundles of information makes it simpler to maintain efficiency 
as opposed to sending everything in one go.After a particular message is broken down into bundles,
these bundles may travel along multiple routes if one route is jammed but the destination remains the same.</p>

<h1>Features of TCP/IP</h1>
<P>1. Segment Numbering System
TCP keeps track of the segments being transmitted or received by assigning numbers to each and every single one of them.
A specific Byte Number is assigned to data bytes that are to be transferred while segments are assigned sequence numbers.
Acknowledgment Numbers are assigned to received segments.<br>
2. Connection Oriented
It means sender and receiver are connected to each other till the completion of the process.
The order of the data is maintained i.e. order remains same before and after transmission.<br>
3. Full Duplex
In TCP data can be transmitted from receiver to the sender or vice – versa at the same time.
It increases efficiency of data flow between sender and receiver. <br>
4. Flow Control
Flow control limits the rate at which a sender transfers data. This is done to ensure reliable delivery.
The receiver continually hints to the sender on how much data can be received (using a sliding window)<br>
5. Error Control
TCP implements an error control mechanism for reliable data transfer
Error control is byte-oriented
Segments are checked for error detection
Error Control includes – Corrupted Segment & Lost Segment Management, Out-of-order segments, Duplicate segments, etc<P>

<h1>Advantages</h1>
<P>
*-It is a reliable protocol.<BR>
*-It provides an error-checking mechanism as well as one for recovery.<BR>
*-It gives flow control.<BR>
*-It makes sure that the data reaches the proper destination in the exact order that it was sent.<BR>
*-Open Protocol, not owned by any organization or individual.<BR>
*-It assigns an IP address to each computer on the network and a domain name to each site thus making each device site to be distinguishable over the network
<P>
<BR><BR>
<h1>Disadvantages</h1>
<P>
*-TCP is made for Wide Area Networks, thus its size can become an issue for small networks with low resources.<BR>
*-TCP runs several layers so it can slow down the speed of the network.<BR>
*-It is not generic in nature. Meaning, it cannot represent any protocol stack other than the TCP/IP suite. E.g., it cannot work with a Bluetooth connection.<BR>
*-No modifications since their development around 30 years ago<BR>
