## 1- What is a proxy server and history?

>I would like to introduce you to the proxy server and a story from the beginning my friend, in the past they wanted to improve the performance and security of Internet connections, so the proxy server was developed in the late nineties and late twenties And it was used, of course, not widely, but it was used mainly by large organizations, such as universities and government agencies, to store frequently accessed web pages and reduce the load on their internal networks. Of course, with the increase in the use of the Internet, the proxy server has become widely used by organizations and companies, and even individuals are using it to a large extent. What is important now is why, what is the reason why all these organizations resort to a proxy server? It is a big priority for us. Of course no one has ever heard of a global internet and you can reach anyone through it for a few seconds. Wait, where's my privacy? Hence the proxy server was used because we use it to anonymize by hiding your IP address, my friend, and not only that, of course, although I think that's enough of the truth, but the most important reason, that it was particularly useful for users In countries with strict laws on internet censorship The important thing is that at the beginning of the twenty-first century it began to be used to maintain more security and privacy, because this is the most important thing in the first place for any person, so it was developed on this basis, my friend, the world has become more anxious than in the past because we use the Internet for every actual need, so unfortunately Fortunately, something called cyber threat has started to advance with the passage of time, attacks, malware development, and many other things. friend but unfortunately that is not the topic we are going to talk about The important thing is that the proxy server is evolving Each day gets better than the day before, and there are more types, and each serves a specific purpose. In recent years my friend proxy has expanded to computers, phones and other devices such as playstation 4 which has a ps4 proxy server and I'll tell you why, I'm sure you're asking yourself why, it wasn't just for protection, what does it have to do with the Playstation? Honestly, I would like to have you sit with me for a while again.


## 2- Why do we use a proxy server?

>I told you that we will use it to protect privacy, so there is something I would like to add to you, which is that companies and organizations preferred the proxy more than us, why because through it they can put certain restrictions on employees and for other needs such as saving bandwidth, improving security of course, and controlling employee access to websites

## 3- How does a proxy server work?

>I'll tell you my friend, it's basically a computer on the Internet with a proxy IP address that knows your machine. about the request i have on my ip address This is what is supposed to happen. No teacher. I will use proxy. What will this do? It will take the request you sent to the global server and send it to an address other than your original address. Then, it will take the information I sent you to the global server and send it to the proxy. My friend, what will I gain from it? I will benefit from the fact that my data is kept away from anyone which means that I will keep my identity

## 4- What are the types of proxy servers and explain every concept?
### We will talk about 8 types, namely:
>1-Forward proxy

>2-Public proxy

>3-Residential proxy

>4-Anonymous proxy

>5-High anonymity proxy

>6-SSL proxy

>7-TOR proxy

>8-Private Proxies

### Of course, there are many, but I will talk about countries

## 1- Forward proxy:
This stays between the device and the public internet, and it passes the deviceâ€™s request to it, and then it goes to check it and applies restrictions and unacceptable usage policies to it


## 2-Public proxy:
It can be used by more than one user. Thus, if you, my dear friend, want to use it, someone else might as well use it.
Although this type is not recommended to be used, it has some advantages such as:

- Most of the public proxy is free

- can support HTTP and SOCKSv5 service;

Many useful together with some SEO tools, such as scrapeBox, if you, my friend, want to collect data from the Internet

## 3-Private Proxies:
Of course, the opposite, my friend, is that not everyone uses the IP address. No, the IP address is reserved for one client at a time
And of course, you enjoy advantages that increase security, of course, because of only one IP address

## 4- Residential proxy:
It allows you, my friend, to choose your location, the country you want, or the city, and you can enjoy your comfort with anyone who lives in this area.
## 5-Anonymous proxy:
This is a tool that tries to make your activity untraceable because it acts as an intermediary and shield for privacy between the computer, the client, and the rest of the Internet, my friend.
## 6-High anonymity proxy:
This is basically an anonymous proxy server that takes the extra step of hiding the user's identity. This is done by deleting user information before the proxy attempts to contact the target site.
## 7- SSL proxy:
An SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) proxy encrypts data sent back and forth on both sides, providing enhanced protection. It is the best choice for organizations for more security.
## 8- TOR proxy:
This proxy directs data across various networks globally present to obscure the user's address. Data is encrypted in multiple layers for further privacy protection and when the data reaches the target destination, each layer is decrypted to reveal the original data.

# 5- Advantages and disadvantages:
## Surely, after all this, you knew the advantages that exist, but let us add things for you, please Advantage:

>1- Improved Performance: By caching frequently accessed web pages and reducing the load on your Internet connection, proxy servers can improve the performance of Internet connections and reduce the time it takes to access websites.

>2-Anonymity: Proxy servers can hide the user's IP address and location, which provides a level of anonymity and protects the user's identity and location.

>3- Security: Proxy servers can help protect users from online threats such as malware and phishing attacks by acting as a barrier between the user and the Internet.

>4-Bypass Censorship: Proxy servers can be used to access websites and content that may be blocked in certain countries or regions.

>5-Shared IP address: When multiple users access the Internet through the same proxy server, they all share the same IP address, which can be useful for anonymity and security.

>6- Increased privacy: By encrypting the data transmitted through the proxy server, VPNs (which use proxy servers) can provide an additional layer of privacy and security for Internet users.

## disadvantages:

>1-Proxy Server Risks: The free installation does not involve much encryption and results in performance issues and potential data security issues

>2- Browsing history log: It stores the IP address Your information is likely to be unencrypted, so always check, my friend, if it records and saves this data and what kind of reception or law enforcement cooperation policies they follow while saving the data.

>3-No encryption: Some do not provide encryption. I mean, I did not send a request. It will be sent as a plain text. Anyone will be able to easily withdraw usernames, passwords, and account information, my friend. So keep checking that the proxy provides full encryption when using it, my friend.
